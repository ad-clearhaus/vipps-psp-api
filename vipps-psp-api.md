# Vipps PSP API version 2

[Vipps på Nett](https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett)
(eCommerce) via PSP offers functionality for payments on
websites and apps (P2B). "Vipps på Nett" provides merchants a solution where
the end user only enters a Norwegian mobile number to make a payment with a
card in the Vipps app.

In the Vipps app the end user selects a payment source to complete the payment
request. Vipps initiates the payment transaction on the selected source and
provide feedback to the PSP of the payment card selected.

The PSP processes the payment transaction and provides feedback to merchant
and Vipps of the payment transaction success or failure.

### PSP implementation checklist

See the [Vipps PSP API Checklist](vipps-psp-api-checklist.md) for details.

### Initiate payment

A payment request is initiated by the PSP to the Vipps API after end user has
request to pay with Vipps. Vipps creates the payment and returns a link to
the Vipps landing page where end user can confirm the mobile number.
Once user has confirmed number the payment can be considered initiated.

### Payment confirmation

After payment initiation, Vipps sends push notification or redirects user to
the Vipps app. End user verifies the Vipps profile by logging in to the Vipps
app. In the Vipps app the end user can select payment source and confirm the amount.

### MakePayment

Once the end user has confirmed the payment on the Vipps landing page, Vipps
shares the encrypted card details with the PSP with
[`POST:makePaymentUrl`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-psp-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_PSP/makePaymentSwaggerUsingPOST).

Vipps does _not_ call the `makePaymentUrl` if the order is not activated by the user. The user activates the order by either accepting/cancelling in the landing page or logging in to the app from a deeplink/landing page redirect. Vipps may also provide additional `makePayment` calls if the user retries a already paid order. In this case the second `makePayment` call should not override the result from the first.

The PSP tries to process the payment through the acquirer and responds to the
`makePayment` call with the payment request status. The end user receives
confirmation in the Vipps app. Vipps redirects the end user to the `redirectUrl`
provided during payment initiation.

## Example request

```json
Authorization: makePaymentToken
{
  "pspTransactionId": "7686f7788898767977",
  "merchantSerialNumber": "123456",
  "cardData": "f0a29801b4#d4ff30e221fa2980ff30e2",
  "confirmed": "YES"
}
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "errorMessage": {
    "errorId": 82,
    "errorText": "Refused by Issuer"
  },
  "paymentInfo": {
    "pspTransactionId": "7686f7788898767977",
    "status": "FAIL"
  }
}
```

## Update status

Since Vipps doesn’t process transactions, updates on payment status are required
in order to deliver expected customer experience. That means that PSP has to inform
Vipps about any PSP payment status change with
[`POST:/v2/psppayments/updatestatus`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-psp-api/#/Vipps_PSP_API/updatestatusUsingPOST).

### Example request

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "pspTransactionId": "7686f7788898767977",
      "status": "CAPTURED",
      "amount": 20000,
      "currency": "NOK",
      "paymentText": "One pair of Vipps socks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "responseInfo": {
    "responseCode": "9000",
    "responseMessage": "SUCCESS"
  }
}
```

## Idempotency

All API requests can be retried without any side effects
by providing the `Request-Id` idempotency key in the header of the request.

In case of network issues or other problems, the API call can be safely retried
with the same idempotency key. The idempotency key is a unique alphanumeric id
generated by the merchant.

```
Request-Id: slvnwdcweofjwefweklfwelf
```

# Authentication

Every API call is authenticated and authorized based on the application
Authorization token (JWT) and APIM subscription key
(`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`).

The following headers are required in every API request
to successfully authenticate every API call:

| Header Name | Header Value | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer 'jwt_access_token'' | type: Authorization token. Value: Access token is obtained from accessToken/get |
| Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key | Base 64 encoded string | Subscription key for the product.<br>Can be found in Vipps developer portal |


## Error codes

| errorId | errorText                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 71      | Invalid request                      |
| 72      | Different texts                      |
| 81      | No such issuer                       |
| 82      | Refused by Issuer                    |
| 83      | Suspected fraud                      |
| 84      | Exceeds withdrawal amount limit      |
| 85      | Response received to late            |
| 86      | Expired card                         |
| 87      | Invalid card number (no such number) |
| 88      | Merchant does not allow credit cards |
| 89      | Insufficient funds                   |
| 91      | Internal error                       |
| 92      | Unable to decrypt                    |
| 93      | Status from Vipps:CANCEL or Status from Vipps:TIMEOUT |

Note 93 is for when the makePayment request from Vipps contains the statuses CANCEL or TIMEOUT. Cancel is when the user cancels in the Vipps app, and TimeOut is when the user does not act on the payment.

### Status Updates

To provide a consistent end user experience it is important that Vipps is notified by changes to the payment status when it is captured, cancelled or refunded. Vipps also provides an endpoint to check the payment status.
